BibViz Project
==============
A project to visualize negative aspects of the Bible in a way that is not only visually appealing but that makes exploring those aspects of the book quick and intuitive.

Data for the website is generated from the Skeptic's Annotated Bible. See the `scripts` directory for how each piece was generated.

The `web` directory contains everything required to serve the website: HTML, JS, CSS, and JSON data files.
