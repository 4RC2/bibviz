BibViz Project
==============
A project to visualize negative aspects of the Bible in a way that is not only visually appealing but that makes exploring those aspects of the book quick and intuitive.

Data for the website is generated from the Skeptic's Annotated Bible. See the `scripts` directory for how each piece was generated.

The `web` directory contains everything required for the website, which is generated by a static site generator called [Wintersmith](http://wintersmith.io/).

First make sure you have Node.js installed, then run some setup commands:

```bash
cd web
npm install
npm install -g wintersmith
```

For a live preview at http://localhost:8080:

```bash
wintersmith preview
```

To build the site:

```bash
wintersmith build
```
