BibViz: Week One
================
BibViz launched exactly one week ago and has been a huge success! I'd like to take this opportunity to write a little bit about the project and how it was able to grow to hundreds of thousands of views so quickly, as well as to thank everyone who participated by blogging about the project, sharing with their friends on social networks, or just visiting and exploring the site.

Who, What and Why
-----------------
The idea for BibViz formed in early August 2013 while browsing around for the Reason Project's biblical contradictions poster after a heated religious debate about biblical literalism and public policy / school programs. I was able to find it, but once again saw that it hadn't been updated to remove duplicate entries and was difficult to navigate or do much with. When a friend suggested that I could do better the thought nagged at the back of my mind.

I did some research and found the excellent Skeptic's Annotated Bible website by Steve Wells, who deserves all credit for crawling through the Bible and finding the various contradictions, violent passages and more. Using his website as a resource I was able to data mine the information with a few quick Node.js scripts and massage the data into a usable format for myself. Then I was able to create a quick basic website and generate charts using D3.js, an open source data visualization library with support for interactive elements through SVG and Javascript.

Why? ... TODO

Coverage
--------
The project has gotten a lot of great coverage from many sources, but I'd like to highlight a few of the larger ones here.

Before I had even publicly announced the site Hemant Mehta of Friendly Atheist emailed me asking about the project - apparently one of his readers had found the site. Hemant had this to say on [his blog](http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist/2013/08/19/an-incredible-interactive-chart-of-biblical-contradictions/) the next day:

> Now, computer programmer Daniel G. Taylor has taken all that data and turned it into a visual masterpiece...
>
> The whole site is seriously an incredible resource. Go there and just play around with it.
> <div><a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist/2013/08/19/an-incredible-interactive-chart-of-biblical-contradictions/">Hemant Mehta, Friendly Atheist</a></div>

After this post was a big surge of traffic from Facebook, but due to the nature of sharing only with friends I'm not able to easily find who shared what there. To my anonymous supporters I say thanks.

Next it was picked up as [#80 for August on Quipsologies](http://www.underconsideration.com/quipsologies/archives/august_2013/arminvit_80.php), and from there it hit Gizmodo in [English](http://gizmodo.com/this-comprehensive-map-traces-463-of-the-bibles-major-1188177994) and Spanish.

> Now, one designer has built a handy map to help us navigate the text.

> Using data from the Skeptic's Annotated Bible, programmer Daniel G. Taylor created this encyclopedic visualization of 463 of the Bible's major contradictions.

It also hit [Misterios Domundo](http://misteriosdomundo.com/este-mapa-revela-463-contradicoes-da-biblia) and with it a slew of Spanish-language tweets flew by.

> Usando dados do próprio livro, o programador e designer Daniel G. Taylor criou este site que contem 463 das principais contradições da Bíblia.
> <div><a href="">Misterios Domundo</a></div>

[Slate](https://twitter.com/Slate/status/371064266880978945) also released a brief tweet about the site, causing a minor spike in traffic:
